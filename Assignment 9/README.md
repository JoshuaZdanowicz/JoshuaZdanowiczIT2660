# Final Project Folder Notes
Contains Every Program I ever created as an atempt for this final assignmwnt, working or otherwise, it might be overkill but more work is better than less. 

RandomGraph.java/ GenerateGraph.java is one program, I recreated the example you sent with my own classes and varablibles etc.


BFS.java, DFS.java and Shortest Path.java are stand alone working programs that implementing each alogorthes on a small size graph. It wasn't until I studdied these that I actually understood the concepts at least from a basic level
